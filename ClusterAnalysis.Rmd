# Problem Description

* In the following Unsupervised Learning activity, we try to cluster various types of breakfast cereal based on their nutritional content.


# Reading & Understanding the Data

* Make sure the dataset is located in your current working directory

```{r}
# Use the setwd() function to get to the directory where the data is present
cereals_data = read.csv('Cereals.csv', header = T)
```


* Use the str(), summary() functions to get a feel for the dataset.

```{r}
str(cereals_data)
summary(cereals_data)
```


* The dataset has 77 observations of 14 variables

* The column/variable names' are self explanatory

```{r}
#See the head and tail of the dataframe
head(cereals_data)

tail(cereals_data)
```



# Data Pre-processing

* Identify the categorical and numerical attributes appropriately

```{r}
#Store all column names in variable called 'attr'
attr = colnames(cereals_data)
attr

#Store all categorical attributes in 'cat_Attr'
cat_Attr = "shelf"

#Now, how to find the numerical attributes?
num_Attr = setdiff(attr, c(cat_Attr, "name"))
num_Attr
```


* Attribute 'shelf' is a categorical variable. Lets convert appropriately.

```{r}
cereals_data$shelf = as.factor(as.character(cereals_data$shelf))
#Now see the structure of the dataframe
str(cereals_data)
```


* Convert the names of the breakfast cereals to the row names, as this will later help us in visualising the clusters

```{r}
rownames(cereals_data) <- cereals_data$name

```


* Drop the name column as it is now just redundant information

```{r}
#cereals_data <- cereals_data[, -c(colnames(cereals_data) %in% ("name"))]
# (or)
cereals_data$name = NULL

```


* Find the number of missing values and either impute or omit them

```{r}
sum(is.na(cereals_data))
```


* There are 4 missing values in dataset, let's impute them using the knnImputation() function

```{r messages = FALSE}
library(DMwR)
sum(is.na(cereals_data$shelf))
cereals_data[,num_Attr] <- knnImputation(cereals_data[,num_Attr], k = 3, scale = T)

sum(is.na(cereals_data))

#How do you find missing values per column?
colSums(is.na(cereals_data))
```

* Convert the categorical to dummy variables (converting to numeric attributes by using dummy)

```{r messages = FALSE}
#Make a copy of the dataframe for later use (mixed attributes)
cereals_data_copy = cereals_data

library("dummies")
shelfDummies = data.frame(dummy(cereals_data$shelf))
#Name the new attributes appropriately
names(shelfDummies) = c("Shelf1","Shelf2","Shelf3")
head(shelfDummies)
```


* Remove the original attribute 'shelf' and add the newly created dummy variables

```{r}
cereals_data$shelf = NULL
cereals_data = data.frame(cbind(cereals_data, shelfDummies))
#check the dataframe using head()
head(cereals_data)
```


* The data must be scaled, before measuring any type of distance metric as the variables with higher ranges will significantly influence the distance

```{r}
cereals_data[, num_Attr] =  scale(cereals_data[,num_Attr], center = T, scale = T)
```


# Data exploration

* We can use the fviz_dist() function from the factoextra package, to visualize the distances between the observations

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, messages = FALSE}
# if install.packages("factoextra") doesn't work, use the following
 if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("kassambara/factoextra")

library(factoextra)
# Use the get_dist() function from the factoexrtra to calculate inter-observation distances
distance <- get_dist(cereals_data)

# The fviz_dist() function plots a visual representation of the inter-observation distances
fviz_dist(distance, gradient = list(low = "#00AFBB", mid = "white", high = "#FC4E07"))
# The gradient argument, helps us define the color range for the distance scale
```



# Hierarchical Clustering  

### 1. Only numerical attributes - distance measure as 'Euclidean'

#### Hierarchical Clustering procedure  

* Let's now perform hierarchical clustering using the hclust() function, for which we'll first need to calculate the distance measures

```{r}
# We use the euclidean distance measure (all attributes are numerical now)
dist <- dist(cereals_data, method = "euclidean")

hc_fit <- hclust(dist, method = "ward.D2")
#ward.D2 method - find the pair of clusters that leads to minimum increase in total within-cluster variance after merging
```


* We can display the dendrogram for hierarchical clustering, using the plot() function

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=14}
plot(hc_fit)

#Plot clusters being surrounded by a border, using the rect.hclust() function
rect.hclust(hc_fit, k = 6, border = "red")
```


* Cut the tree to 6 clusters, using the cutree() function

```{r}
points_hc <- cutree(hc_fit, k = 6)

# Store the clusters in a data frame along with the cereals data
cereals_clusts_hc <- cbind(points_hc, cereals_data)

# Have a look at the head of the new data frame
colnames(cereals_clusts_hc)[1] <- "cluster_hc"
head(cereals_clusts_hc)
```


#### Quality of Clusters Created

* Shiloutte width

    - The silhouette width/value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation)  [i.e., intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation]
    - Ranges from -1 to +1  
    - Values closer to 1 means higher quality of the cluster created 

```{r}
library(cluster)
dist = daisy(x = cereals_data, metric = "euclidean")

sil_value = silhouette(points_hc, dist = dist)
plot(sil_value)
```


* Try to find the optimal number of clusters where silhouette width would be maximum

```{r}
sil_value_hc = 0
for (i in 2:20) {
  points_hc <- cutree(hc_fit, k = i)
  sil_value_hc[i] = mean(silhouette(points_hc, dist = dist)[,3])
}
plot(1:20, sil_value_hc, type = "b", xlab = "No: of Clusters", ylab = "Silhouette Width")
```


#### Cluster Stability

* Using library(fpc) - clusterboot function

```{r}
library(fpc)

#Input the scaled cereals_data
hclust_stability = clusterboot(cereals_data, clustermethod=hclustCBI, method="ward.D2", k=6, count = FALSE)
hclust_stability
```


* Analyze the clustering results  

```{r}
clusters = hclust_stability$result$partition 
```


* What are the cluster stabiltiy values? Values > 0.85 denote very stable clusters. 0.6 - 0.75 means the clusters show some patterns but needs to be investigated further  

```{r}
#Cluster stability values
hclust_stability$bootmean 
```


* How many times the different clusters were dissolved  

```{r}
#Cluster dissolution rate. If maximum Jaccard coefficient < 0.5, that cluster is assumed to be dissolved. Below code shows the number of times each cluster was dissolved. The lower the value, the better.
hclust_stability$bootbrd 
```



### 2. Mixed attributes - distance measure as 'gower'

#### Hierarchical Clustering procedure - mixed attributes

* Let's now perform same hierarchical clustering using the hclust() function, for mixed datatypes

```{r}
#Scaling the numeric attributes
cereals_data_copy[,num_Attr] = scale(cereals_data_copy[,num_Attr],scale=T,center=T)

#Calculating gower distance
library(cluster)
gower_dist = daisy(cereals_data_copy,metric = "gower")
head(gower_dist)
class(gower_dist)

#Now that you have the distance matrix, do the hclust()
hc_fit_mixed <- hclust(gower_dist, method = "ward.D2")
```


* We can display the dendogram for hierarchical clustering, using the plot() function

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=14}
plot(hc_fit_mixed )
```


* Cut the tree to 6 clusters, using the cutree() function

```{r}
points_hc_mixed <- cutree(hc_fit_mixed , k = 6)

# Store the clusters in a data frame along with the cereals data
cereals_clusts_hc_mixed <- cbind(points_hc_mixed, cereals_data)

# Have a look at the head of the new data frame
colnames(cereals_clusts_hc_mixed)[1] <- "cluster_hc_mixed"
head(cereals_clusts_hc_mixed)
```


* Plot a new dendogram, with each of the clusters being surrounded by a border, using the rect.hclust() function

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=14}
plot(hc_fit_mixed)
rect.hclust(hc_fit_mixed, k = 5, border = "red")
```


#### Quality of Clusters Created

* Shiloutte value - mixed

```{r}
library(cluster)
gower_dist = daisy(x = cereals_data_copy, metric = "gower")

sil_value_hc_mixed = silhouette(points_hc_mixed, dist = gower_dist)
plot(sil_value_hc_mixed)
```



# K-Means Clustering

#### K-Means Clustering procedure

* Build a basic kmeans model with k = 2, using the kmeans() function

```{r}
set.seed(123)
km_basic <- kmeans(cereals_data, centers = 2, nstart = 20)

str(km_basic)
fviz_cluster(km_basic, cereals_data)
```


* The kmeans() function returns a list of 9 objects which include the cluster assignments ("cluster"), cluster centers ("centers"), etc. You can further explore the returned object by calling the str() function on the returned object and going through the documentation


* Let's now build a screen plot to choose a "k"

```{r}
# Initialize wss to 0
wss <- 0

# From 1 upto upto 10 cluster centers, fit the kmeans model
for (i in 1:20) {
  cfit = kmeans(cereals_data, centers = i, nstart = 20)
  # Store the sum of within sum of square
  wss[i] <- sum(cfit$withinss)
}
plot(1:20, wss, type = "b")

set.seed(123)
fviz_nbclust(cereals_data, kmeans, method = "wss")
```



* Let's choose k as 6 and cluster the data

```{r}
set.seed(123)
km_clust <- kmeans(cereals_data, 6)
#Not using 'nstart' parameter for reproducability during cluster stability checking. Initial centriods would be chosen based on set seed here.

# after choosing k as 6, let's store the cluster groupings along with the data in a new data frame
km_points <- km_clust$cluster

# Store the cluster assignments in a new data frame
cereals_clusts_km <- as.data.frame(cbind(km_clust$cluster, cereals_data))

# Look at the head of the data
head(cereals_clusts_km)

colnames(cereals_clusts_km)[1] <- "cluster_km"
```



* We can visualise the clusters by plotting the data using the fviz_cluster() function which plots the points on the first two principal components

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=14}
fviz_cluster(km_clust, cereals_data)
```


#### K-Means Cluster Quality

* Shiloutte value
```{r}
library(cluster)
dist = daisy(x = cereals_data, metric = "euclidean")

sil_value = silhouette(km_clust$cluster, dist = dist)
plot(sil_value)
```


#### Cluster Stability in kmeans

* Using library(fpc) - clusterboot function

```{r}
library(fpc)

#Input the scaled cereals_data
#Input the samee seeds used above for reproducability of clustering performed
km_stability <- clusterboot(cereals_data, clustermethod=kmeansCBI,krange = 6, seed = 123, count = FALSE)
km_stability
km_stability$result[1]
```


* Analyze the clustering results  

```{r}
groups_km = km_stability$result$partition 
groups_km
```


* What are the cluster stabiltiy values? Values > 0.85 denote very stable clusters. 0.6 - 0.75 means the clusters show some patterns but needs to be investigated more  

```{r}
#Cluster stability values
km_stability$bootmean 
```

* How many times the different clusters were dissolved  

```{r}
#Cluster dissolution rate. 
km_stability$bootbrd 
```
